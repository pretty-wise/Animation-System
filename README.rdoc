== Animation System

This is an excerpt from my Master's thesis: "Animation Control System for Interactive Articulated Objects". It's an implementation of skeletal animation system which includes many useful features, such as:
* additive animation blending
* partial skeleton blending
* independent animation layers
* cross-fading
* data-driven blend trees
* data-driven animation states and named transitions
